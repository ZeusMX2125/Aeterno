I need to fix the structural layout, spacing, and functionality issues in the current build, and URGENTLY implement the missing animated background. Please execute the following strict refinements:

1. IMPLEMENT ANIMATED GRADIENT BACKGROUND (Priority):
   - The background is currently static. I need a "Moving Futuristic Gradient" effect on the HTML `body` or a fixed background container.
   - CSS Implementation Strategy:
     - Use a `linear-gradient` with an angle (e.g., -45deg).
     - Colors: Deep Black (#000000), Dark Grey (#1a1a1a), and a VERY subtle deep orange (#4a1a00) or deep purple. It must remain dark, not bright.
     - Set `background-size: 400% 400%`.
     - Create a CSS `@keyframes` animation that moves the `background-position` from 0% 50% to 100% 50% and back.
     - Animation duration: 15s infinite ease.
   - This must cover the entire viewport fixed behind the content.

2. FIX THE NAVIGATION BAR (Sticky Header):
   - The Navigation Bar (Logo, Links, 'Let's Talk' button) is currently bugged and floating in the middle of the page body (above the 'What We Do Best' section).
   - Move this entire Navigation Bar element to the very top of the HTML structure.
   - Set its CSS to: `position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; z-index: 9999;`
   - Add a dark glassmorphism background to it (`rgba(0,0,0,0.8)` with blur) so it is legible as the user scrolls.

3. FIX NAVIGATION FUNCTIONALITY (Smooth Scroll):
   - Ensure the Nav Links work as "Anchor Links" for a Single Page Application experience.
   - "Work" link -> smooth-scrolls to the "Visual Storytelling" section ID.
   - "Services" link -> smooth-scrolls to the "What We Do Best" section ID.
   - "Contact" / "Let's Talk" -> smooth-scrolls to the footer or contact form.

4. FIX CARD READABILITY & TEXT OVERLAP:
   - In the "Web Development" and "Social Media" cards, white text is unreadable against light images.
   - Implement a "Gradient Scrim" overlay: Add a `linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0.9) 100%)` that sits *behind* the text but *in front* of the background image.
   - Add `padding: 24px;` inside all cards. Text must not touch the edges.

5. STANDARDIZE VERTICAL SPACING (Rhythm):
   - Create a global CSS variable for section spacing (e.g., `--section-padding: 120px`).
   - Apply `padding-top: var(--section-padding)` and `padding-bottom: var(--section-padding)` strictly to EVERY major section container to fix the inconsistent gaps.

6. FOOTER/NAV CLEANUP:
   - Remove the duplicate Nav bar that was floating in the middle of the page.
   - Ensure the Footer stays at the bottom.

Maintain the current color palette (Black, White, Safety Orange) and font choices.
