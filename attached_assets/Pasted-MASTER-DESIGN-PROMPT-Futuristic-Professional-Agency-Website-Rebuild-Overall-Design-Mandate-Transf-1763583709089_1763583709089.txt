MASTER DESIGN PROMPT: Futuristic Professional Agency Website Rebuild

Overall Design Mandate: Transform the current agency website into a cohesive, high-end, futuristic, and professional showcase. Prioritize elegant dark UI, subtle dynamism, unified visual language, and clear user journeys. Every element should feel premium and intentional.

GLOBAL STYLING & CORE AESTHETICS:
Color Palette:

Primary: #000000 (Pure Black) for background.

Accent: #FF4500 (Safety Orange) - used for primary CTAs, active states, subtle glows, and key text highlights.

Secondary Text/Details: White (#FFFFFF) and light grey (#CCCCCC) for readability.

Glassmorphism Effect: A dark, semi-transparent background (e.g., rgba(18, 18, 18, 0.6)) with a backdrop-filter: blur(10px); and a very subtle 1px white or light grey border (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)).

Typography:

Font Family: Use a modern, highly legible variable sans-serif font (e.g., Inter or Plus Jakarta Sans from Google Fonts) to allow for precise weight control.

Headlines: Bold, strong weights for impact.

Body Text: Optimized for readability on a dark background.

Subtext/Descriptions: Slightly increased size for improved legibility compared to current.

Background Dynamic (Hero & Select Sections):

Moving Futuristic Gradient: Implement a subtle, slow-panning, multi-directional gradient background, primarily within the black/dark grey spectrum with hints of the Safety Orange or a deep blue/purple. This should be achieved via CSS keyframe animations on a large background element (e.g., a ::before pseudo-element on the hero section). The movement should be almost imperceptible until consciously observed, adding depth without distraction.

Subtle Noise Texture: Overlay a highly transparent (3-5% opacity) grainy noise texture (background-image: url('noise.png');) across the entire site to prevent banding and add a premium, film-like quality.

Interaction Design (Hover/Active States):

All interactive elements (buttons, cards, links) should have smooth, subtle transitions and hover effects.

Hover effects should utilize the Safety Orange for highlights, text color changes, or soft glows.

HEADER & NAVIGATION:
Top Navigation Bar (New Addition):

Persistent & Transparent: A discreet, transparent navigation bar fixed to the top of the viewport.

Left: Agency Logo (clean, monochromatic version of current logo).

Right: Primary Navigation Links (e.g., "Services," "Work," "About," "Contact") and a prominent "Let's Talk" button (Safety Orange fill, white text).

Hover Effect: Links subtly glow orange on hover.

Service Ticker:

Keep the existing ticker style.

Positioning: Ensure it sits logically, providing immediate context below the main hero headline.

SECTION-BY-SECTION REDESIGN:
A. Hero Section:
Headline: "DIGITAL EXPERIENCES WORTH REMEMBERING" (Current excellent).

Sub-headline: "Creative agency specializing in photography, web development, and digital marketing services." (Increase font size slightly for readability).

CTA Button: "Start Your Project" (Primary Safety Orange button).

Background: Incorporate the Moving Futuristic Gradient as described above, ensuring it adds depth without detracting from the text.

Atmosphere: A subtle, very slow-moving particle or ethereal fog effect using an HTML5 Canvas or CSS (if performant enough) to enhance the "alive" feeling of the dark space.

B. "IT ALL STARTS WITH THE PERFECT CAPTURE" (Visual Storytelling Grid):
Headline: "IT ALL STARTS WITH THE PERFECT CAPTURE" (Current excellent).

Sub-Headline: "Click for more details." (Update text to reflect interaction).

Card Design (OVERHAUL):

Glassmorphism Style: Replace current solid gradient cards with dark, semi-transparent backgrounds (rgba(18, 18, 18, 0.6)), backdrop-filter: blur(10px);, and a 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) border.

Color Use: Instead of solid background colors, use the Safety Orange as a subtle glow around the card on hover or a very subtle gradient within the card background on hover. The default state should be dark/glassmorphic.

Content: Keep the icon and text (e.g., "Brand Videos").

Interaction (CRITICAL):

Hover for Dynamic Preview:

Brand Videos: On hover, the card's background animates to play a very short (3-second), muted, looping video clip demonstrating a brand video.

Product Photography: On hover, the card's background zooms slowly into a high-resolution, compelling product photo.

Lifestyle Sessions: Similar to product photography, showcase a lifestyle shot.

Live Sessions / Social Content / Event Coverage / Portrait Sessions: On hover, the card reveals a dynamic, quickly rotating carousel of 2-3 relevant high-quality images within the card's background area.

C. "WE BUILD YOUR BRAND'S DIGITAL HOME" (Website Development Section):
Headline: "WE BUILD YOUR BRAND'S DIGITAL HOME" (Current excellent).

Card Design: Apply the Glassmorphism Style from the Visual Storytelling section for consistency.

Card Content (OVERHAUL):

"Strategic Planning" (Current good): Keep.

"Polished & Professional" (Placeholder Text, Update): Change to "Conversion Focused Design".

"Responsive Design" (Weak, Update): Change to "Performance First Development".

Visuals (OVERHAUL):

Device Mockups: Instead of flat screenshots, use sleek, 3D-rendered device mockups (laptop, tablet, phone) that appear to be subtly floating or layered in the foreground. These mockups should contain placeholder website screens that reflect a modern, dark UI aesthetic.

Subtle Animation: The mockups could have a very slight, slow translateY animation to give them a "floating" feel.

CTA Button: Change "Get a Quote for a Website" to a more general "View Our Web Work" or "Explore Our Process" – deferring a direct quote request until later.

D. "THEN, WE TELL THE WORLD" (Social Media Marketing Section):
Headline: "THEN, WE TELL THE WORLD" (Current excellent).

Card Design: Apply the Glassmorphism Style from other sections for consistency.

Card Content:

"Mobile First": Keep.

"Audience Engagement": Keep.

"Strategic Planning": Keep.

Visuals: Maintain the existing dark, clean aesthetic but ensure the placeholder images within the cards are visually engaging and consistent with the overall futuristic brand.

CTA Button: Change "Get a Quote for Socials" to "View Our Marketing Results" or "Discover Our Strategy."

E. "PROVEN RESULTS" Section:
Design: Maintain the current clean, minimalist, dark card style for this section; it works well.

Interactivity (CRITICAL):

Number Animations: When the user scrolls this section into view, the numbers (500+, 120+, 2.5M+, 98%) must dynamically count up from 0 to their final value. This adds a powerful, engaging element.

F. "WHAT WE DO BEST" Section:
Design: Maintain the current clean, minimalist card style.

Icons: Ensure the icons are consistent with the overall brand aesthetic (monochromatic, clean lines).

Content: Ensure descriptions are concise and impactful.

G. Footer:
Maintain existing clean, minimalist footer design.

Ensure social icons are consistently styled (e.g., white or orange on hover).

CONVERSION STRATEGY (Simplified CTA Flow):

Primary CTA (Sticky Header & Hero): "Start Your Project" / "Let's Talk" - leading to a unified contact form.

Section CTAs: Re-purpose "Get a Quote" buttons to "Explore Our Work," "View Our Process," or "See Case Studies." These should guide users deeper into specific service pages or a portfolio, rather than immediately demanding a quote.

Unified Contact Form: A single, comprehensive contact form at the bottom of the site or on a dedicated contact page. This form should include a dropdown or checkboxes for "What services are you interested in?" (Photography, Web Development, Social Media Marketing, etc.).
