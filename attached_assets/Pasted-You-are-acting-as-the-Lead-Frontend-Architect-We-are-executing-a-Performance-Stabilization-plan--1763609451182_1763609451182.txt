You are acting as the Lead Frontend Architect. We are executing a "Performance Stabilization" plan.

**Current Status:** The site is unusable due to WebGL Context Overload. We have too many heavy background effects (`LiquidEther`, `GridScan`, `Particles`) crashing the browser.

**The Mandate:**
1. **Keep** `Aurora.jsx` ONLY for the Hero Section (`Hook.tsx`).
2. **Delete/Remove** usages of `LiquidEther`, `GridScan`, and `Particles` from all other sections.
3. **Replace** the backgrounds in `Scene1`, `Scene2`, and `Scene3` with a high-end, static **CSS "Dark Glass" styling**.

### STEP 1: UNINSTALL BLOAT
Remove these dependencies from `package.json` if they are no longer used by Aurora:
- `face-api.js` (Confirmed delete)
- `postprocessing` (Confirmed delete)

### STEP 2: COMPONENT REFACTORING
**1. Refactor `Scene1_Photography.tsx`, `Scene2_WebDev.tsx`, `Scene3_SMM.tsx`:**
   - Remove the imports for `LiquidEther`, `GridScan`, `Particles`.
   - Apply a standard CSS class for the background: `bg-neutral-950`.
   - Add a subtle CSS radial gradient to the container instead of the heavy React component:
     ```css
     /* Example Replacement Style */
     background: radial-gradient(circle at 50% 50%, #1a1a1a 0%, #000000 100%);
     ```

**2. Refactor `Hook.tsx` (Hero):**
   - Ensure `Aurora` is the ONLY background here.
   - This will be the *single* WebGL context allowed on the page, ensuring it never crashes.

**3. Clean up `App.tsx` / `Main.tsx`:**
   - Ensure no other global canvas elements are being rendered.

### STEP 3: SCROLL ANIMATION FIX
Now that the heavy backgrounds are gone, fix the `GSAP` scroll logic in the Scenes:
- In `Scene1`, `Scene2`, `Scene3`:
- Ensure `ScrollTrigger` uses `pin: true` ONLY for desktop (`min-width: 1024px`).
- Remove any `canvas` related resizing logic from these files.

### EXECUTION GOAL:
The site must load instantly. Scrolling must be 60fps. The "Black Void" bug should be gone because we are no longer relying on crashing WebGL canvases for backgrounds.

Proceed with these deletions and CSS replacements immediately.
