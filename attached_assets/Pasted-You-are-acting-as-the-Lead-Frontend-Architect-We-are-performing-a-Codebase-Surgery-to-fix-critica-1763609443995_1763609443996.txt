You are acting as the Lead Frontend Architect. We are performing a "Codebase Surgery" to fix critical rendering bugs, lag, and structural issues.

**Objective:** Convert the site into a high-performance, single-page scroll experience. Remove "Tabs", fix the "Black Void" scroll bugs, and eliminate lag.

### PHASE 1: STRUCTURAL SIMPLIFICATION (The Layout Fix)
**1. Remove "Tabs" & Complex Navigation:**
   - Delete `components/ui/tabs.tsx`.
   - If `OtherCapabilities.tsx` or any section uses Tabs, refactor it immediately to a simple **CSS Grid** layout.
   - Ensure the page flows vertically: Hook -> Photography -> Web Dev -> Social Media -> Stats -> Contact.

**2. Fix the "Black Space" Scroll Bug (GSAP):**
   - The `ScrollTrigger` pinning is breaking the layout.
   - **ACTION:** Disable `pin: true` for MOBILE and TABLET devices in `Scene1`, `Scene2`, and `Scene3`. Pinning should ONLY happen on `min-width: 1024px`.
   - **Code Update:**
     ```javascript
     ScrollTrigger.create({
       trigger: containerRef.current,
       start: 'top top',
       end: '+=100%',
       pin: window.innerWidth > 1024, // CONDITIONAL PINNING IS CRITICAL
       scrub: 1,
     });
     ```

### PHASE 2: PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (The Lag Fix)
**1. Remove "Face-API" & "PostProcessing":**
   - These libraries are massive and unused. Uninstall them.
   - In `GridScan.jsx`, remove all imports related to `face-api.js` and `postprocessing`. Use standard THREE.js or OGL only.

**2. Fix "Tilt Card" Event Listener Spam:**
   - Currently, every card in `Scene1` and `Scene2` attaches a `mousemove` listener. This causes stuttering.
   - **ACTION:** Refactor `TiltCard` to use **CSS-only 3D transforms** (using `group-hover`) OR use a single mouse listener on the parent container that passes coordinates down via Context.
   - **Preferred Fix:** Switch to CSS variables for mouse position to handle the tilt effect on the GPU, not the CPU.

**3. Fix "ScrollVelocity" Bloat:**
   - We are loading `Framer Motion` just for one marquee effect.
   - **ACTION:** Rewrite `ScrollVelocity.tsx` to use GSAP `to()` with a simple infinite loop. Uninstall `framer-motion`.

### PHASE 3: WEBGL CONTEXT MANAGER (The Invisible Background Fix)
Browsers are killing your backgrounds because there are too many active contexts.
**ACTION:** Create a HOC (Higher Order Component) or Hook `useIntersectionPause`.
   - Apply this to `GridScan`, `LiquidEther`, `Aurora`, and `Particles`.
   - Logic: If the section is NOT in the viewport, `cancelAnimationFrame` immediately.
   - This will free up the GPU for the section the user is actually looking at.

### EXECUTION PLAN:
1. **Uninstall** `face-api.js`, `framer-motion`, `postprocessing`.
2. **Refactor** `Scene1`, `Scene2`, `Scene3` to disable pinning on mobile.
3. **Rewrite** `GridScan.jsx` to remove the heavy AI imports.
4. **Replace** `ScrollVelocity` with a GSAP version.
5. **Verify** no black spaces appear on scroll.

Execute this plan immediately.
