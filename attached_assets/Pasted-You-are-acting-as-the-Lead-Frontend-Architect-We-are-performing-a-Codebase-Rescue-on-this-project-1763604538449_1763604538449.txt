You are acting as the Lead Frontend Architect. We are performing a "Codebase Rescue" on this project. The current build is suffering from severe performance lag, WebGL context loss, and layout rendering issues due to library bloat.

You must strictly follow this remediation plan to fix the Animated Backgrounds, the Curved Text, and the Lag.

### PHASE 1: DEPENDENCY & BLOAT CLEANUP
1. **Library Consolidation:**
   - We are currently using BOTH `Three.js` AND `OGL`.
   - **Action:** Refactor `LiquidEther.jsx` and `GridScan.jsx` to use `OGL` (like Iridescence) OR standard Three.js, but do not mix them if possible. If mixing is necessary, you MUST implement strict cleanup.
   - **Action:** Remove `face-api.js` completely. It is imported in `GridScan.jsx` but we have disabled webcam features. It is a massive library causing lag.

2. **Animation Library Standardization:**
   - We use both GSAP and Framer Motion.
   - **Action:** Standardize on **GSAP** for all scroll-based interactions.
   - Refactor `ScrollVelocity.tsx` to use GSAP instead of Framer Motion, or if Framer is kept, ensure it is lazy-loaded.

### PHASE 2: FIXING THE WEBGL CONTEXT LOSS (Invisible Backgrounds)
The site attempts to render 5+ WebGL canvases simultaneously. Browsers limit this (approx 8 contexts), causing backgrounds to disappear.

**Action:** Implement a strict `IntersectionObserver` Manager for all background components (`Iridescence`, `GradientBlinds`, `GridScan`, `LiquidEther`, `Particles`).
1. Modify every background component to accept a `paused` prop.
2. When the component is NOT in the viewport, `paused` must be `true`.
3. When `paused` is true:
   - `cancelAnimationFrame` must be called immediately.
   - The WebGL context should ideally be preserved but rendering must stop 100% to save GPU.
   - If context loss occurs, implement a `gl.getExtension('WEBGL_lose_context')?.restoreContext()` handler.

### PHASE 3: FIXING COMPONENT BUGS

**1. Fix `CurvedLoop.tsx` (Text Rendering):**
The curved text calculates width before the font loads.
- **Fix:** Wrap the `useEffect` width calculation in `document.fonts.ready.then(() => { ... })`.
- Ensure the SVG `path` logic handles window resizing dynamically.

**2. Fix `LiquidEther.jsx`:**
- The current file contains duplicate/corrupted code.
- **Action:** Rewrite `LiquidEther.jsx` to be a clean, minimal implementation using the Three.js standard shader approach, ensuring it accepts the `colors` prop correctly for the brand theme (Black/Orange).

**3. Fix `Navigation.tsx`:**
- Ensure the navbar has a high `z-index` (50+) and a distinct backdrop blur so it doesn't blend into the background contents.

### PHASE 4: PERFORMANCE TUNING
1. **Lazy Loading:**
   - Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to load the heavy background components (`LiquidEther`, `GridScan`) only when they are nearing the viewport.
2. **CSS Optimization:**
   - Ensure `will-change: transform` is used only on active animating elements, not globally.

### EXECUTION ORDER:
1. Uninstall `face-api.js`.
2. Fix `CurvedLoop.tsx` font loading issue immediately.
3. Refactor `GridScan` and `LiquidEther` to remove unused imports and implement the `IntersectionObserver` pause logic.
4. Verify all backgrounds render visible.

Start by fixing `CurvedLoop.tsx` and cleaning up the `face-api.js` dependency.
